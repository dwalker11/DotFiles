# Add yourself some shortcuts to projects you often work on
# Example:
#
# brainstormr=/Users/robbyrussell/Projects/development/planetargon/brainstormr
#

# Set my default terminal for i3
export TERMINAL=gnome-terminal

# I like to view my directories before files
alias lsg='ls --group-directories-first'

# set the terminal font (easy) 7/19/2014
alias terminusB='setfont ter-u24b'

# for even bigger font
alias bigT='setfont ter-u28b'
